## Weekly report

First launch

* https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-gbxml-viewers-for-openstudio

Updates

* Spider gbXML Fixer 'Atrax' v0.05.00-7dev
* Spider gbXML Viewer Dev 0.17.03-4sgv


## Updating repo Read Me files

Theo:

* I have started adding text and things to the read me files for reops
* This includes links so you can view gbXML files with the Viewr

Questions

* Is this OK for me to do?
* Is thee anything we should or shoulf not add?
* There are dozens more links to gbCML files that could be added but this could become tedious. See below

## Custom Spider gbXML Viewer for Green Building XML

* Problem: The GitHub repos contain dozns of gbXML files. Adding libks to read files so gbXML files may be viewed in 3D is time-consuming
* Solution there is a custom viewer available so that
	* All the files may be quickly and easily viewable
	* Using the GitHub API, you always view all the files and all the versions


## Business development opportunities

### Sample files

* gbXML sponsors should be requested to submit files the sample file repositories
* Selected files should be more than test cases but should be a demonstration of thhe sponsor's skill and cumen in dealing with gbXML
* When there is a sufficient numbet of files, the sponsors will be charge an annual fee to keep their files on the current 'build' reales of the repos
* Eventually, prizes and awards for the best files are voted on by users and judges


### Standards and Standards organization

Theo asks:

* Are there connections between gbXML and OSM, IDF, IFC, EPW, KML, CityXML, STL, IGES, DXF and other AEC idustry standards?
* Are there connections between Green Building XML and ASHRAE, ANSI, ASTM, ISO, LEED and other standards organizations
* Are there connections to industry besides IBPSA?

If so, then I would like to document. If not, then let's build some. The industry of industry standards is a growth industry


## Links of Interest

Theo: from about a year ago, I have the follopwing links. I would like to update these and add then to GitHub somewhere.


### Green_Building_XML

* http://www.gbxml.org/

> gbXML is an industry supported schema for sharing building information between disparate building design software tools.

* https://github.com/GreenBuildingXML
> Repositories for all things gbXML including validator source code, test cases, and more...

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Building_XML

> The Green Building XML schema (gbXML) is an open schema developed to facilitate transfer of building data stored in Building Information Models (BIM) to engineering analysis tools. gbXML is being integrated into a range of software CAD and engineering tools and supported by leading 3D BIM vendors. gbXML is streamlined to transfer building properties to and from engineering analysis tools to reduce the interoperability issues and eliminate plan take-off time.
